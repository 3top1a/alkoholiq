Alkoholiq, a programming language that transpiles to Brainfuck.

You can pipe the syntax above into the program, or put it into a file.
The binary can either compile the code and print it, or it can also interpret the code and print what it outputs.

For example, run
```bash
cargo r -- examples/lir/fib.lir
# 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55
```

or to see the compiled Brainfuck code:
```bash
cargo r -- examples/lir/fib.lir -b
# ... safe to say it's long
```


The internals are explained in the [DESIGN.md](https://github.com/3top1a/alkoholiq/blob/main/DESIGN.md) document.

Examples can be found in the [examples](https://github.com/3top1a/alkoholiq/tree/main/examples/lir) folder.

## The name?

The name stems from alcoholism, because, well, I'm from the Czech Republic where beer is cheaper than water.
*Alkoholik* is a short Czech translation of an alcohol addict.
Inspired by our automotive manufacturer, *Å koda*, that have started naming all of their new cars with the letter q at the end, I decided to do the same.
Tune in next time for *QDE Qonnect*.

## Q&A

I will not be taking any questions, thank you.
