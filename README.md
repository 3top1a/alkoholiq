Alkoholiq, a programming language that transpiles to Brainfuck.

You can pipe the syntax above into the program.
The output is not executable immediately, and needs to be piped into a brainfuck interpreter/compiler such as [my 540 byte brainfuck interpreter](https://github.com/3top1a/sbfi-rs) or the online [Brainfuck Debugger](https://kvbc.github.io/bf-ide/).

For example, run
```bash
cat examples/lir/fib.lir | cargo r
```
and copy the output into the online Brainfuck Debugger.


The internals are explained in the [DESIGN.md](https://github.com/3top1a/alkoholiq/blob/main/DESIGN.md) document.

## The name?

The name stems from alcoholism, because, well, I'm from the Czech Republic where beer is cheaper than water.
*Alkoholik* is a short Czech translation of an alcohol addict.
Inspired by our automotive manufacturer, *Å koda*, that have started naming all of their new cars with the letter q at the end, I decided to do the same.
Tune in next time for *QDE Qonnect*.

## Q&A

I will not be taking any questions, thank you.
